# Silent Hill PC feature catalog

> **Status — Current guide.** Source and build configuration are authoritative. Use the [operational reference](pc_port/docs/Console_And_Debug_Reference.md) for controls, console commands, and debug tools, or the [documentation index](pc_port/docs/README.md) for design and audit records.

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **I** | Implemented and expected to work in the current build. |
| **E** | Experimental, partial, restricted, platform-specific, or awaiting coverage. |
| **D** | Disabled, superseded, planned, or absent. |

## Launch and platform

| Area | Current behavior | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows CLI | `SilentHillPC.exe -data <directory>` changes only the directory searched for disc images. A direct image path does not work; config, mods, logs, and saves remain relative to the working directory. `-h` / `--help` prints usage. Unknown options and a trailing `-data` are ignored. | I |
| Windows | Native C11/C++17 game using PsyCross, SDL2, OpenGL, OpenAL, and JPEG; separate .NET Framework 4.7.2 launcher/updater. | I |
| Linux/macOS | Current CMake, texture-pack code, and map loader are POSIX-safe; `build.sh` covers Linux and macOS, and overlays use `.so`/`.dylib`. The Windows launcher is not available on POSIX. | E |
| Disc selection | USA, PAL, and NTSC-J probing; `region = auto` prefers USA, then PAL, then NTSC-J. `disc_image =` is empty/automatic by default; a value selects an exact `.bin` filename in `gamedata/`. | I |
| Launcher/updater | Disc/display probing; SHA-256 loose/ZIP updates that preserve config and saves; launcher self-update only to a newer version. | I |

The game has no RAR reader. Texture packs are directories or ZIP files; the Windows launcher may extract a RAR into a loose `.rar.extracted` folder before launch.

## Current capabilities

| Area | Current capability | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rendering | Arbitrary resolution; windowed/fullscreen/borderless; 4:3, Hor+, or stretch 3D presentation; optional 2D pillarboxing; VSync/FPS limits; nearest/dither/bilinear filtering; MSAA. | I |
| Effects and lighting | Nine post-process looks, four tone maps, four flashlight modes, adjustable beam/effect mix, and real-time flashlight shadows. | I |
| PGXP | Runtime-effective precise projection, perspective-correct interpolation, edge handling, and near clipping; default off. `USE_PGXP=0` is vestigial because current paths are built unconditionally and runtime-gated. | E |
| World rendering | Culling override, chunk preload, expanded resident texture pool, and texture overrides/packs. | I |
| Whole-map exteriors | Opt-in scenic draw/preload for outdoor cells; default off, resource-heavy, and awaiting coverage after the v2 redesign. | E |
| Classic controls | Fixed-camera tank controls through the original PSX input path; primary/secondary keyboard-or-mouse and controller action binds. | I |
| Alternate controls | TPS, OTS, and FPS styles share alternate bindings; mouse/pad look, OTS shoulder swap, aim assist/crosshair, optional 2D movement, and optional FPS head tracking. | E |
| Mouse cursor | `mouse_cursor = 1` by default. Mouse hover/click/wheel works in the title menus, save/load, options, and cursor puzzles only while the OS pointer is free; captured TPS/OTS/FPS look remains unaffected. | I |
| Save/load | Original MCD format, checksum, endings, ranking, and New Game+ state. F6/F8 open the original save/load screens during settled gameplay; they are not snapshots. | I |
| Audio | Original SEQ/VAB/SMF BGM through SPU/OpenAL; positional/ambient SFX; ADSR and reverb mapping; separate BGM, SE, XA voice, and FMV movie volume. | I |
| Disc media | Thirty table streams: nine XA-only voice entries plus 21 STR/MDEC movies with interleaved XA. Original BIN playback uses 4-bit XA and MDEC; 8-bit XA is unsupported. | I |
| AVI overrides | `gamedata/fmv/*.avi`; 64-bit/OpenDML and 4K+ files; MJPEG aliases, RGB DIB, and raw YUV video; PCM 8/16/24/32-bit integer or float32. Compressed audio plays silent; unsupported video falls back to the BIN movie. | I |
| Maps | 43 registry names: built-in `map0_s00` plus 42 optional map modules. Missing modules use metadata-only stubs. `chara_global` is an additional pseudo-map module for portable AI, not a story map. | E |
| Global character pool | `global_chara_pool = 1` by default. PC-side assets and portable AI backfill allow cross-map console spawns while native registrations and authored natural spawns keep priority. | I |
| Pool limitations | Map-bound actors/boss phases and Chicken can be `[no-ai]` statues; foreign monsters may use wrong or silent map-local SFX. See [Global character pool](pc_port/docs/Global_Chara_Pool.md). | E |
| Localization | PAL disc languages and NTSC-J Rev1/2 paths are implemented but partial; PAL still needs coverage, long localized messages can clip, and JAP0 proceeds after a warning with incompatible Rev1/2 tables. | E |
| Modified discs | Exact-image selection and disc-authoritative USA text support in-place fan translations; unchanged retail discs remain a no-op. | I |
| Loose modding | `gamedata/load/...` TIM/PNG/byte overrides require `allow_loose_files = 1`; texture replacement has documented palette/page restrictions. | E |
| Developer tools | Gated overlay console, cheats, collision visualization, free camera, FPS eye tuner, animation inspector, spawning, and render/audio tuning. | E |
| Beta monsters | No beta monster restoration is shipped. Chicken has assets but no AI; other proposals require invented behavior. | D |
| Randomizer | Not implemented; its document is scoping only. | D |

## Settings

All PC Options rows persist. Window state, VSync, filtering, PGXP, effects, flashlight, culling, FPS, volumes, controls, and map selection apply as shown; only MSAA and chunk preload require restart.
