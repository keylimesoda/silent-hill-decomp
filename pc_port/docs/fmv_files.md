# FMV and XA stream files

> **Status — Supporting reference.** Current media capability is summarized in the [feature catalog](../../features.md); console playback and skip controls are in the [canonical operational reference](Console_And_Debug_Reference.md). See also the [documentation index](README.md).

The disc table contains **30 streams**: nine XA-only voice entries and 21 STR/MDEC movies with interleaved XA audio. The port plays them directly from the selected region's BIN. For movie overrides, extract with [jPSXdec](https://github.com/m35/jpsxdec/releases/tag/v2.0), match disc order to the table below, and save the AVI under its base filename:

```text
gamedata/fmv/<base filename>.avi
```

For example, use `gamedata/fmv/C1_20670.avi`. Missing or unsupported overrides fall back to the original BIN stream.

## Filename convention

The 5-digit suffix after the underscore is the number of CD sectors the
stream spans on disc (e.g. `M1_03500` = 3,500 sectors). It's part of the
on-disc directory entry and the PC port uses it to validate that the
extracted file matches the expected stream — keep the suffix in the
filename.

## Pre-extracted XA-only streams (2044–2052)

The first nine entries are audio-only XA streams for in-game voice
playback (Cybil's dialogue, hospital diaries, etc.), not video or AVI
override slots. The port reads them directly from the BIN. The `fmv`
console command lists only the 21 movie entries.

## What happens without the AVIs

The PC port has a built-in MDEC software decoder. If an AVI override
isn't present, it decodes the original PSX stream straight from the BIN
and plays the interleaved XA audio through SDL. The result is identical
content, just at the original 320×240 resolution.

## Supported AVI formats (upscale mods)

There is **no file size or resolution limit**: 64-bit offsets, OpenDML
(`RIFF AVIX`) multi-gigabyte files, and 4K+ frames all play (the decode
buffer sizes itself from the video). Any frame rate in the AVI header is
honored.

Video codecs:

- **MJPEG** (fourcc `MJPG`, `dmb1`, `jpeg`, `AVI1`, any case) — the
  recommended format: `ffmpeg -i in.mp4 -c:v mjpeg -q:v 3 -c:a pcm_s16le out.avi`
- Uncompressed RGB DIB (24/32 bpp)
- Raw YUV: `YUY2`/`YUYV`, `UYVY`, `I420`/`IYUV`, `YV12`, `NV12`

Audio: integer PCM 8/16/24/32-bit and float 32-bit
(`pcm_u8/s16le/s24le/s32le/f32le`), including WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE.
Compressed audio (MP3/AAC/AC3) is not decoded — the video plays silent
and `SilentHill.log` prints the re-encode hint.

A file using an unsupported *video* codec (H.264, Xvid, …) is not an
error: the port logs the fourcc and falls back to the original disc
movie for that slot.
