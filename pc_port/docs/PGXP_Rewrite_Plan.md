# PGXP Complete Rewrite — Shadow-Memory Model (DuckStation-faithful)

> **Status — Historical/superseded plan.** Runtime PGXP is implemented as an **E** feature and defaults off; this proposed rewrite is not current status. See the [feature catalog](../../features.md), [operational reference](Console_And_Debug_Reference.md), and [documentation index](README.md). The analysis below is retained as design history.

**Original status:** PLANNED. Self-contained spec — execute from a fresh context.
**Goal:** Replace the entire home-grown PGXP matching (address map + per-prim parked
set + (x,y) ring + closest-(x,y) + slot-index + weld) with one deterministic
shadow-memory model, faithful to DuckStation. Result: characters and environment
both correct — no collapse, no wobble, no seams, no gaps, no flicker. Where a vertex
isn't tracked it falls to **clean affine** (PSX look), never garbage.

---

## 1. Why the current approach fails (do not repeat these)

The current system tries to *re-associate* a drawn vertex with its precise GTE
projection using heuristics, because the precise value is stored under the GTE's
scratch address but the GPU draws from a *different* address (the prim packet the
game copied it into). Every heuristic has a failure mode we cycled through tonight:

- **(x,y) ring** (match by integer screen coord + hint): collisions → wobble, and
  cross-prim joint verts get different precise → **seams**.
- **closest-(x,y)** (nearest parked vert): two corners on the same pixel grab the
  same vertex → **flat collapse** (pews, crucifix, Harry's legs).
- **value-as-primary-key** (match parked vert whose integer value equals drawn):
  same-pixel corners share a value → also **collapse**.
- **slot-index** (parked slot i = drawn vertex i): correct *only* where the drawer's
  copy order matches the park order; silently wrong elsewhere.
- **weld** (snap nearby cross-bone verts): papers over coverage gaps, overshoots
  into **collapse**; DuckStation has no weld.
- **small vs big hash tables**: small → everything overflows to the ring (`det=0`);
  big → parked tier used but the heuristics above bite.

Root cause: **incomplete + non-deterministic coverage.** The fix is not a better
heuristic — it's making coverage complete and address-exact so no heuristic is needed.

## 2. How DuckStation actually works (the reference)

Source: `github.com/stenzek/duckstation` → `src/core/cpu_pgxp.cpp` / `.h`
(was `pgxp.cpp`; pull with `gh api -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.raw"
"repos/stenzek/duckstation/contents/src/core/cpu_pgxp.cpp"`).

DuckStation is a CPU emulator. It keeps a **shadow array parallel to PSX memory**
(`s_mem`, one `PGXPValue` per memory word) plus shadow CPU/GTE registers. Every
relevant CPU instruction is hooked (`CPU_LW/SW/LWC2/SWC2/MOVE/ADD/...`) to *copy the
shadow value along the same data path* as the real value. So when a vertex is
projected by the GTE (`GTE_RTPS` stores precise x,y,z into a shadow register) and
the game shuffles it through memory into a GP0 packet, the precise value rides
along to wherever the GPU finally reads it.

`PGXPValue` (cpu_pgxp.cpp): `{ float x, y, z; u32 flags; u32 value; }` where
`flags` has `VALID_X/Y/Z` bits and **`value` is the integer word it shadows**.

The GPU-side lookup is the whole game (cpu_pgxp.cpp):

```cpp
bool GetPreciseVertex(u32 addr, u32 value, int x, int y, int xOffs, int yOffs,
                      float* out_x, float* out_y, float* out_w) {
  const PGXPValue* vert = GetPtr(addr);                       // shadow at SOURCE ADDRESS
  if (vert && (vert->flags & VALID_XY) == VALID_XY && vert->value == value) { // EXACT value validate
    *out_x = TruncateVertexPosition(vert->x) + xOffs;
    *out_y = TruncateVertexPosition(vert->y) + yOffs;
    *out_w = vert->z / GTE::MAX_Z;
    if (IsWithinTolerance(*out_x, *out_y, x, y))               // garbage guard
      return (vert->flags & VALID_Z) == VALID_Z;
  }
  // vertex cache (match by value only) — OFF by default ("makes warping worse")
  // MISS: out = (x, y), w = 1  -> affine
  *out_x = x; *out_y = y; *out_w = 1.0f; return false;
}
```

**Takeaways that define our rewrite:**
1. Primary key is the **unique memory address** the vertex word came from.
2. `value` (the integer word) is only a **validation**, never the key.
3. Coverage comes from **complete propagation through memory**, not heuristics.
4. No (x,y) ring (value-cache is off by default). No nearest-match. No weld.
5. Miss → **affine** (`x, y, w=1`), always clean.
6. Seams don't exist because both joint verts are tracked end-to-end and project to
   the same precise value → they coincide. (No weld required.)

## 3. Our adaptation (we have NO CPU to hook)

The decompiled game runs as native code — there is no instruction stream. But we
have the **source**, so we instrument the exact points where vertex words move:

- **GTE projection** → already ours (`PsyX_GTE.cpp GTE_RotTransPers` already computes
  the precise `fx,fy` and pushes a FIFO `s_pgxpFifoX/Y/W`). Keep.
- **GTE store** (`gte_stsxy*` macros, ours, in `pc_port/include/.../inline_no_dmpsx.h`
  or wherever the `gte_stsxy3c / gte_stsxy3_g3 / gte_stsxy` live) → writes the integer
  to a dest address. Here we write the **shadow**: `Shadow_Store(destAddr, fifo.x,
  fifo.y, fifo.w, integerValue)`. (Today this is `PGXP_StoreAddr`/`PGXP_MapPut`; add
  the integer value.)
- **Vertex copy** (`poly->xN = screenXy_0[field]` in the drawers) → the missing
  piece. After each copy, **propagate the shadow**: `Shadow_Copy(&poly->xN,
  &screenXy_0[field])` which does `shadow[dst] = shadow[src]` if present. This puts
  the **prim-field address** into the shadow, so the GPU side resolves by address.
- **GPU draw** (`MakeVertex` path in `PsyX_GPU.cpp`) → `GetPreciseVertex(primFieldAddr,
  drawnIntegerValue, ...)` exactly like DuckStation: address lookup + value validate +
  tolerance → precise, else affine.

This is address-exact and deterministic: a vertex is either propagated (precise) or
not (clean affine). No collisions, no collapse, no oscillation.

## 4. Data structures

```c
struct ShadowEntry { uintptr_t key; u32 gen; u32 value; float x, y, w; };
// one big open-addressed hash table keyed by native address of the vertex WORD.
// `value` = the packed integer (s16 x | s16 y << 16) that lives at key.
// `gen`   = frame generation (bumped once/frame) for stale-entry rejection.
```

Sizing: must hold every projected vertex word AND every copied prim-field word for
one frame (~230k verts → up to ~0.5–1M words). Use `2^20`–`2^21` open-addressed,
~16-probe. (Memory is cheap; correctness first. Tune after it works.)

Keep the precise **FIFO** in `PsyX_GTE.cpp` as the bridge from "GTE projected this"
to "the store macro knows the address."

## 5. Implementation steps (in order, each independently testable)

> Build: `"C:/msys64/usr/bin/bash.exe" -lc 'export MSYSTEM=MINGW64 && cmake --build
> /c/Claude/silenthill/silent-hill-decomp/pc_port/build 2>&1'`. Exe relink fails
> "Permission denied" while the game is running — that's fine, user closes it.
> Log: `pc_port/build/SilentHill.log`. PGXP toggles: console `pgxp 0/1`, F1.

**Step 0 — keep OFF byte-identical.** All shadow work is gated by `g_PsxUsePgxp`.
PGXP-off path must be untouched/affine. Verify first.

**Step 1 — Shadow store + value.** Add `value` to the shadow entry. In the
`gte_stsxy*` macros, after writing the integer to the dest address, call
`Shadow_Store(destAddr, fifoX, fifoY, fifoW, *(u32*)destAddr)`. Confirm direct-store
prims (effect quads via `gte_stsxy3_g3` → prim field) resolve via address+value at
draw (these need NO copy step — the GTE writes straight into the prim).

**Step 2 — GPU lookup = GetPreciseVertex.** Rewrite the `MakeVertex` resolve to:
look up shadow[primFieldAddr]; if present, `gen==cur`, `value==drawnValue`, and
within 2px tolerance → use precise (`+ draw offset`); else affine (`x,y,w=1`).
Delete the parked-set/ring/closest/slot/weld tiers. After this step only direct-store
prims are precise; everything copied is affine (expected) — confirm NOTHING warps or
collapses (clean affine fallback), env may look mostly affine. That's the safe floor.

**Step 3 — Copy propagation in the core drawer.** In
`src/bodyprog/gfx/bodyprog_80055028.c` `Gfx_MeshDraw`, at the two emit sites where
`poly->x0..x3 = scratchData->screenXy_0[field_10..13]` (≈ lines 2188 and ~2855),
after each assignment add `Shadow_Copy(&poly->xN, &scratchData->screenXy_0[field_1X])`
(behind `#ifdef SH_PC_PORT`, gated by `g_PsxUsePgxp`). This is where the existing
`PsyX_SetNextPrimPgxp` bridges are — replace them. Now world meshes + characters
resolve by address. Verify: env detail correct, NO collapse, Harry's faces solid.

**Step 4 — Remaining copy sites.** Same propagation at: `func_8005AC50` GT3/GT4
emit, the FT4 "second render path" (~3040), and any other `screenXy_0 → prim` copy.
Grep `screenXy_0` and the old `PsyX_SetNextPrimPgxp` call sites for the full list.
Each instrumented site = exact coverage; each missed site = clean affine.

**Step 5 — Billboards stay affine.** `Gfx_BillboardDraw` builds quad corners in
screen space (never GTE-projected) — do NOT propagate; leave affine (current
`PsyX_SetNextPrimAffine` behaviour). 2D/HUD likewise affine.

**Step 6 — Delete the dead machinery.** Remove `PgxpVtx`/parked table/`PgxpPrimStore`/
`PGXP_BeginPrim`, the ring (`PGXP_LookupHinted` and its push), `WeldVertex` + all weld
console cmds/globals, `g_pgxpCharSnap`/CHARSNAP (no longer needed — full PGXP is the
only mode and it's correct), slot plumbing. Keep `g_primPgxpForceAffine` for billboards.

**Step 7 — Tune + verify seams gone.** With full coverage, the two bone-joint verts
(same world position) project to the same precise value and coincide → seams vanish
with no weld. Confirm on Harry. Re-add a coverage probe (`det% / affine%`) only if a
gap remains; chase it to the un-instrumented copy site.

## 6. Key facts learned tonight (don't re-derive)

- **GTE clamping/garbage** (`PsyX_GTE.cpp` ~316): the prim stores the GTE's *clamped*
  integer (`Lm_G1`), but PGXP keeps the *unclamped* float. For verts behind camera /
  extreme depth the unclamped float is **garbage** — that's why the 2px tolerance
  guard (`IsWithinTolerance`) is REQUIRED even on an exact address match. Without it
  the scene shatters. (DuckStation has the same guard.)
- The precise FIFO (`s_pgxpFifoX/Y/W`) already mirrors the GTE SXY FIFO so the store
  macro can attach precise to an address. Reuse it.
- `Gfx_MeshDraw` copy order IS aligned (`poly->x0..x3 = screenXy_0[field_10..13]` in
  order, no winding swap) — verified. So address propagation there is straightforward.
- `det=0` on small tables means parked tier unused (overflow). Irrelevant after this
  rewrite (no parked tier).
- DuckStation's vertex-cache (value-only fallback) is OFF by default and makes
  warping worse — do not add an (x,y) fallback.
- Coverage gap → affine is acceptable and safe; never add a heuristic to fill it.

## 7. Files

- `pc_port/PsyCross/src/gpu/PsyX_GPU.cpp` — shadow table, `Shadow_Store/Copy`,
  `GetPreciseVertex`, delete parked/ring/closest/weld.
- `pc_port/PsyCross/src/gte/PsyX_GTE.cpp` — FIFO (keep), gate (keep).
- gte store macros header (`gte_stsxy*`) — `Shadow_Store` on store.
- `pc_port/PsyCross/src/render/PsyX_render.cpp` — shader already texture-only PGXP;
  no change expected (verify `ppw` semantics: position is W-independent, W only
  perspective-divides varyings).
- `src/bodyprog/gfx/bodyprog_80055028.c` — copy propagation (Gfx_MeshDraw, ~2188,
  ~2855), `func_8005AC50`, FT4 path.
- `pc_port/src/pc_console_cmd.c` — drop WELD/WELDW/CHARTEX/CHARSNAP, keep `pgxp`.

## 8. Success criteria

PGXP on: environment intricate scenes (church/pews/crucifix) crisp, no gaps/flicker;
Harry full-PGXP has NO flat collapse, NO seams, NO wobble, looks like clean affine
with stable sub-pixel positions. PGXP off byte-identical to affine. No new crashes.
